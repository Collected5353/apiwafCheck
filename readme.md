Python Script to Detect API Framework from Endpoint

This script uses the requests library to make a GET request to an API endpoint, then parses the response headers to detect the potential API framework used. Please replace api_url in the main function with your actual API endpoint URL.


Installation

To use this script, you will need Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:



requests (for making HTTP requests)


You can install these libraries using pip:


Copy Code
pip install requests
Usage


Save the provided code in a detect_framework.py file.

Replace api_url with your actual API endpoint URL.

Run the script from the command line or terminal:


Copy Code
python detect_framework.py
The script will print the detected framework name, or "Not Detected" if no framework could be identified.


Limitations

This script is not foolproof and may not work for all cases. It relies on checking header information and specific strings in the response headers or body. The accuracy of the detection depends on the consistency of these strings across different API implementations.
